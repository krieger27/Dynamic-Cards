# Dynamic-Cards

## Requirements

1.  Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled *Create*.
2.  When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM that includes it's own delete button. You decide the height/weight of the card.
3.  When the user clicks the *Delete* button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM.  Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.
